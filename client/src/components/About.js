        New Scots got Talent: Migrants (including asylum seekers) can create
        profiles where they list their skills, expertise and which jobs they're
        qualified to do. Employers can post job opportunities and migrants can
        "match" with the job ads. The focus is on highlighting the wasted
        talents of people who can't work in line with campaigns like #lifttheban{" "}
